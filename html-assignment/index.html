<h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
<p>
 I'm Jashanpreet Singh, a 20-year-old from Punjab, India, with big dreams. I finished high school in 2023 from 
   <abbr title="Army Public School">APS</abbr> Public School, Amritsar. I got access to the internet in 6<sup>th</sup> 
   grade when YouTube was getting popular in India. I was super curious about what I could do online, so I started 
  learning video editing and even picked up Photoshop.
   </p>
      <p>
     In 9th grade, I chose Computer IT as my optional subject, and that's when I got into coding. In 2023, I started 
     a YouTube channel and hit 589 subscribers with 107K views in just three months. I was so happy, but my parents 
     weren't. They thought <em>I was wasting time, so they decided to send me abroad.</em></p>
